Untracked ==> Staged ==> Unmodified ==>Modified ==> Staged==> loop
lets explain:
At first, file stored as untracked. git can't track that file. after add that file, git can track that file. that file is now staging area. when we commit that file, then that file is alocate as unmodified. Now we have two option, remove that or edit that. if we edit it goes to modified. we should again add that file to staging area. and so on.

}
git add abc.txt {for move a file to stage from untracked}
git add -A {for move a file to stage from untracked}


touch akd.txt {for create a file}

git commit -m "This is a massege" {for move a file to unmodified from staged}
